# To-Do List Project

## Description

This is an interactive To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to manage their tasks with features such as adding, editing, marking as complete, and removing tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's **localStorage**, ensuring they persist even after the page is reloaded or the browser is closed. The design is responsive, making it suitable for both mobile and desktop devices.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks by typing them in a text input and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify any task by clicking the "Edit" button, allowing you to update the task's text.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Check off tasks as completed using a checkbox, with visual feedback.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks from the list using the "Remove" button.
- **Data Persistence**: The tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even after reloading the page or reopening the browser.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for various screen sizes, providing a user-friendly experience on both mobile and desktop.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the page, including input fields and task list elements.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsiveness, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity for managing tasks, including adding, editing, and removing items, as well as saving data in `localStorage`.
